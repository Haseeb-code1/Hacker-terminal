README File for Hacking Simulator
Overview
This project is a simple hacking simulator that mimics a terminal interface. It displays a series of messages with a blinking effect to create an engaging user experience. The background color changes periodically, and sound effects are included to enhance the simulation.

Features
Terminal-like Interface: Displays messages that simulate hacking activities.
Blinking Effect: Messages blink with dots to mimic a real terminal.
Background Color Change: The background color changes between green, red, and black.
Sound Effects: Audio cues are played during the simulation.
Files Included
html.html: The main HTML file that structures the simulator.
js.js: The JavaScript file that contains the logic for the blinking messages and background color changes.
style.css: The CSS file that styles the simulator's appearance.
radio_beep.mp3: An audio file used for sound effects during the simulation.
Installation
Clone the repository or download the files.
Open html.html in a web browser to run the simulator.
Usage
Upon opening the simulator, it will start displaying messages with random delays.
The messages include:
Initializing the hacking simulator
Reading files
Detecting password files
Sending files to the server
Cleaning up
The background color will change, and sound effects will play throughout the simulation.
Customization
You can modify the messages in the js.js file to change what the simulator displays.
Adjust the timing and colors in the JavaScript functions to customize the experience.
License
This project is open-source and available for personal use. Feel free to modify and distribute it as you wish.
